### Beta Version of CryptoMinerals:

- CryptoMinerals is a Crypto collectible game available via Metamask to collect, extract and polish digital minerals.
- Gemstones are non-fungible tokens (see [ERC #721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721)) that are indivisible and unique.
- The smart contract is built on the Ethereum network; ether will be necessary to fuel transactions, which include extracting, trading, and polishing CryptoMinerals.
- For the testing purpose beta version of the game will run within the Rinkeby test network. Also the source code will be available for review.
- The game starts in a marketplace where you need to buy ORE for a symbolic amount of ether (a discount for the first 10k).
- When you receive the ore it will show up in your user profile where is possible to extract it. From the extraction you will get a random but unique rough gemstone.
- Currently, there are 50 types of gemstones which are randomly generated during the purchase process straight on the Blockchain. It means the buyer becomes an ultimate owner of the gem.
- In the beta version, ether can be obtained for free at https://faucet.rinkeby.io/
- Any relevant feedback or found issue will be rewarded in the live version
